# Advent of code 2021

<https://adventofcode.com/>

This is my first time doing this. I doubt I'll get very far.

I'm using [elm](https://elm-lang.org/) with a goal of readable,
self-documenting code using composable functions.

To run the examples, after installing elm,
run `elm reactor` from this directory and navigate to `src/Main.elm`.

or use [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) if you want debug mode:
`elm-live src/Main.elm -- --debug`
